        <p>So I am a small town boy, who grew up in the outdoors, always playing outside, exploring, experimenting and
            just
            LIVING ! <br>
            We grew up in a time, without technology. Where a calculator was still considered a giant leap for mankind
            and
            the only way to change the <br>
            TV, was to ask the youngest sibling you had, and if you were the youngest, tough luck. So by the time
            cellphones
            and computers came out, <br>
            I was already a fullgrown kids at the time, who knew how to pass time without technology. Technology was not
            really trusted back then <br>
            , so the chances of you getting a cellphone as a present, was very slim. So during holidays, my friends and
            I,
            found ourselves some chores <br>
            to do, to earn ourselves a little money, and by the time we went to High-School, we all had ourselves a
            cellphone. <br>

            As a young teenager, we don't think about our future that much, well, not in a realistic way for that
            matter. We
            just have unrealistic <br>
            dreams and unpractical ideas. So I loved competing in sports, so I always thought, it will be what I'll
            after
            school. But then life <br>
            happened, and I finished High-School, without having a career plan.

        First, I tried tapping into my love for the outdoors, working as a Game Rancher on a Wildlife Farm. I really
        loved it, but quickly realised
        that my love for the outdoors should remain something I do for fun, and not as a profession.
        I then moved to more adrenaline-filled, disciplined and law-enforcement environment, by becomming a
        Provincial
        Traffic Officer. I grew up in a
        very strict household and at school level, I was always considered a leader in all aspects of my
        school-career,
        so I figured that this
        would be a good fit for me. Upholding the law and serving people. Certainly had a good ring to it. Although
        it
        had a lot of good aspects
        and exciting things that happened, it was not a very rewarding career. I had to witness and endure a lot of
        things that no person ever should.

    <p>
        While I was working as a Traffic Officer. I always had this feeling deep inside of me, that I was meant for
        more, than this.
        I certainly felt I was worth more than how I was treated. I was constantly searching for something that
        would
        make me feel
        like I a had purpose again. </p>

    <p>
        And one day it happened. A Online-gaming friend, who happened to be a Software Engineer, saw something in
        me,
        and hom knowing my competitive
        nature well at that stage, challenged me to do very simple Web Page, using just HTML. He said it might be
        "too
        advance" for me and immediately
        my brain went "Challenge Accepted !". I did my little bit of studying and watched a few videos of core
        concepts
        being explained
        and pretty soon, I was able to show my friend this pretty basic, Web Page that I have designed. I felt so
        proud!
        So the challenges
        went on, getting more and more complex and after sometime, I was able to develop a very average looking Web
        Page, using HTML, CSS and
        very basic Javascript. I did not make to much of it. Did I enjoy it? Yes, I loved it, but never once did I
        think
        of it as a career. Like
        I mentioned in the beginning, I was raised in a small town, with a small-town-mentality. I did not know
        careers
        in technology even existed
        and to be honest, I never really even thought about it in that way. Then one day my Online-Friend, knowing I
        am
        not happy with my current profession
        asked me why I don't consider becoming a Software developer. I told him that it can't be possible doing
        Software
        Development as a career
        and that it was more a hobby rather than a actual job. I remember him laughing and to told me to go do some
        research on Software Developers.
        I remember with that sentence, that spark I was searching for so long, just got ignited. I remember
        fantasizing,
        me , becomming a Programmer. </p>

    <p>
        I remember thinking about everything that could go wrong, but deep down, between all that voices, there was
        a
        soft, yet optimistic Voice, saying
        , "But what if this works out ?". And that voice grew louder with time and at the age of 25, I decided to
        start
        planning for the future I want
        rather than settling for a future I don't want. I saved up my own money over the years, and I wasn't going
        to
        ask my parents to fund MY dreams. I enrolled for
        a College to get the basic fundemenatls right and to get some
        sort of qualification
        and at the end of 2021, I resgined from my work as a Traffic Officer and I was off chasing a possibility

        So currently, I am a student, enrolled at CTU Training Solutions, doing a Programming Foundation Course and I am
        LOVING it !
        I do love writing code and actually seeing some pretty impressive results! I enjoy interacting with other
        aspiring
        programmers
        and listening to their stories and why they would like to become developers!
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently started doing an Internship at an amazing company and I absolutely love doing actual programming
        work.
        It is a very steep learning curve but I believe with hard work and determination, I will make it to the other
        side a
        better, well-rounded Programmer ! <br>
        At the end pf the day, I love programming! I love the endless possibilities of opportunities, ideas and
        creativity
        that Coding provides.
        I love how everyone can express themselves in their own unique way of coding and I love the effect that a good
        piece
        of Software can have on a person.

    <p>
        Success, freedom, peace, financial stability and happiness are the things a work towards for my future. I would
        like
        to <br>
        become a very successful programmer and I want to enjoy what I do. I want to be the best in my field and someone
        you
        can <br>
        always count on. And I hope that one day, I can look back at this crazy journey and be able to tell myself <br>
        "We made it."
